## Note-taking

I've recently discovered the [Zettelkasten](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/organization/how-to-use-the-zettelkasten-method) method of note-taking.

This is one of the reasons I've started this blog to create the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) webpages you are currently browsing. 

The link between them being the [YouTube Zettelkasten guide](https://youtu.be/L2z7j7Jho4E?si=III3V-zqcIaMRv71) I found used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which uses Markdown.
