## Wealth Inequality

[Wealth Economics](https://www.wealtheconomics.org)

I've been watching this guy on YouTube recently, and have since read his book.

As a reaction to this I'm making a few changes to how I live;

1. I've moved to shopping with Waitrose, who are an employee owned business. [John Lewis Partnership](https://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/about/who-we-are.html)
2. I bank with Nationwide, who are member owned. [Nationwide](https://www.nationwide.co.uk/about-us/)
3. I use Signal for messaging as far as possible to avoid Meta. [Signal](https://signal.org)
